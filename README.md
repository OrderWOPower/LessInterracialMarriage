In the vanilla game, there is no limit to the number of foreign nobles that can marry into a faction.

This meant that after a few generations, all of a faction's nobles could be of a different culture from the original faction.

In response to a request, I added a check to stop nobles of different cultures from marrying each other if the number of foreign nobles is greater than or equal to 10% of the total number of nobles in their factions.

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
